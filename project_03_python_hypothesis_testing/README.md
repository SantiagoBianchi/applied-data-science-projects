# Hypothesis Testing – Goals in Men's vs Women's World Cup Matches

This project compares the number of goals scored per match in men's and women's FIFA World Cup games using statistical hypothesis testing.

The analysis focuses on selecting appropriate tests based on data distribution and interpreting results in a clear and reproducible way.

## Key Steps
- Data loading and filtering
- Feature engineering (total goals per match)
- Exploratory data analysis
- Normality assessment using the Shapiro–Wilk test
- Hypothesis testing using the Mann–Whitney U test
- Interpretation of statistical results

## Tools
- Python
- pandas
- seaborn
- scipy
- pingouin

## Structure
- `data/`: datasets used for the analysis
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebook with the full workflow

## Notes
This project is part of my applied data science portfolio and focuses on statistical inference rather than predictive modeling.
