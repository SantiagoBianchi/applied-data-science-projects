Project 05 – Bayesian Growth Models



This project applies Bayesian growth models to describe and compare growth patterns in Zearaja brevicaudata. The analysis is focused on estimating biological growth parameters through MCMC methods, allowing uncertainty to be explicitly quantified.



The project is part of a personal portfolio of applied data science projects, with an emphasis on ecological and fisheries applications.



Objectives



Fit Bayesian growth models to biological data



Estimate key growth parameters:



Asymptotic length (L∞)



Growth coefficient (k)



Length at birth (L₀)



Observation error (σ)



Evaluate MCMC convergence and diagnostics



Visualize posterior distributions and model behavior
