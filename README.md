# Applied Data Science Projects

This repository contains applied data science projects focused on data analysis, statistical modeling, and machine learning using Python and R.

The projects emphasize end-to-end workflows, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), modeling, visualization, and interpretation of results on real-world datasets.
