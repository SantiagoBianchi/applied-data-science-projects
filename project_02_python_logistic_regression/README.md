# Logistic Regression – Car Insurance Claims

This project analyzes car insurance data to identify which customer features are most predictive of insurance claim outcomes.

Separate logistic regression models are fitted for each feature to assess their individual predictive power.

## Key Steps
- Data loading and inspection
- Missing value analysis and mean imputation
- Feature-wise logistic regression modeling
- Model evaluation using classification accuracy
- Identification of the strongest predictive feature

## Tools
- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- statsmodels
- matplotlib
- missingno

## Structure
- `data/`: dataset used for the analysis
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebook with the full workflow

## Notes
This project is part of my applied data science portfolio.
